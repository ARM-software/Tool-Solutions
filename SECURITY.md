## Supported Versions

Our policy for fixing released versions is that we will only patch the latest
release, not all affected releases. This project operates a rolling calendar
release, fixes may come in future releases, but they will not be backported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in `Tool-Solutions/ML-Frameworks/pytorch-aarch64` or
`Tool-Solutions/ML-Frameworks/tensorflow-aarch64`, report it to the relevant upstream
project first. Otherwise email psirt@arm.com with a description of the vulnerability.
