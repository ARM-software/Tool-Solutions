# The logic in this script should mirror the upstream build pipelines as closely
# as possible, along with Tool-Solutions specific changes we want to test (e.g.
# installing tbb) or improving local development in a way that doesn't affect
# the result (e,.g. unsetting MAX_JOBS). Currently the upstream logic is defined
# in tensorflow/ci/official
